We present a method for obtaining approximate solutions to the problem of optimal execution, based on a signature method. The framework is general, with minimal assumptions about the underlying asset. Following an approximation of the optimization problem, we calculate an optimal solution for the trading speed using the so-called _signature trading strategies_.
